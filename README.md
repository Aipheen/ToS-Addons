# Tree of Savior Addons

### FPS Savior

Similar to [adjv's](https://github.com/axjv) SFX Toggle however instead of changing settings based on your fps I made it so you can just toggle between 3 predefined settings High, Low, and Super Low. Current Setting is displayed right below the FPS display's default location.

Use the ingame macro system (f8) to set `/fpssavior` to any key you want in order to toggle quickly.

* [High] Exactly how it sounds, everything is set to high.

* [Low] Lowest settings except effects are still visible. Players drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 15, and monsters drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 30.

* [Super Low] This is the lowest I could make the settings while still being able to see what your doing. Not recommended for PvP since some effects are not visible and you won't see players until they are close to you. Players drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 0, and monsters drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 5. I created this mode for world bossing, since you don't need to see anything except for the boss and your own aiming circles to dps it.

This is likely obvious but FPS Savior is not compatible SFX Toggle, use only one or the other if you use both they will conflict with each other.
