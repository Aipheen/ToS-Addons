# Tree of Savior Addons

### FPS Savior v1.0.4

Similar to [adjv's](https://github.com/axjv) SFX Toggle however instead of changing settings based on your fps I made it so you can just toggle between 3 predefined settings High, Low, and Super Low. This is likely obvious but FPS Savior is not compatible SFX Toggle, use only one or the other if you use both they will conflict with each other.

Current Setting is displayed right below the FPS display's default location. This display is movable.

* [High] Exactly how it sounds, everything is set to high.

* [Low] Lowest settings except effects are still visible. Players drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 15, and monsters drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 30.

* [Super Low] This is the lowest I could make the settings while still being able to see what your doing. Not recommended for PvP since some effects are not visible and you won't see players until they are close to you. Players drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 0, and monsters drawn outside a certain range from you is limited to 5. I created this mode for world bossing, since you don't need to see anything except for the boss and your own aiming circles to dps it.

##### Slash Commands (Use the ingame macro system (f8) to use slash commands more efficiently.)
* `/fpssavior` to toggle between High, Low, and Super Low.
* `/fpssavior lock` to unlock/lock the settings display in order to move it around.
* `/fpssavior default` to restore settings display to its default location.

### Zoomy Plus v1.0.3

This mod is based off of and named after [Excrulon's](https://github.com/Excrulon) Zoomy v1.0.0 that he took off of the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Addon-Manager) due to people whining about it being unfair. While it is true that it gives an unfair advantage in Team Battle League many people use it anyway and its available for anyone to download/install. Really IMC should just disable the custom camera zoom function while in Team Battle League fixing the issue all together. Honestly its more unfair to those who didn't install Zoomy before it was taken off the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Addon-Manager) since those who already had it installed still have it. Besides, this can be used to capture some very neat pictures at angles normally not possible so I wanted to share.

Current Zoom level and XY coordinates are displayed right below (if you have it) the current FPS Savior setting display which is right below the FPS display's default location. This display is movable and hideable.

Use Page Up to zoom in and Page Down to zoom out. Doing so while holding Left Ctrl makes zooming in and out 5 times faster. Also while holding Left Ctrl you can press and hold Right Click to rotate the camera by moving the mouse!

##### Slash Commands (Use the ingame macro system (f8) to use slash commands more efficiently.)
* `/zplus zoom <num>` to go to a specific zoom level anywhere between 50 and 1500!
 * Example: `/zplus zoom 800`
* `/zplus swap <num1> <num2>` to swap between two zoom levels!
 * Example: `/zplus swap 350 500`
* `/zplus rotate <x> <y>` to rotate camera to specific coordinates between 0 and 359!
 * Example: `/zplus rotate 90 10`
* `/zplus reset` to restore default xy positioning and zoom level.
* `/zplus reset xy` to restore default positioning to xy only.
* `/zplus display` to show/hide the coordinate display.
* `/zplus lock` to unlock/lock the coordinate display in order to move it around.
* `/zplus default` to restore coordinate display to its default location.
* `/zplus help` for help ingame.
